This code for Milfhy studio grid. this web have can do solo rn, but for better exprience add other web with laravel for order ( make schedule call ( redirect on Milfhy bento grid to milfhy web order ) you can acces on this https://github.com/Milfhy/support-bento-grid
why does it have two different frameworks? because of my campus assignments, web programming is free to use any framework, while the web programming practicum is required to use Laravel and this website has to be put together, so this is what I created, a portfolio display using React and orders using Laravel.
